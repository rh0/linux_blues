---- linux_blues ----
A minimalist, yet elegant configuration and theme for the awesome window
manager (v3.5).

awesome window manager: http://awesome.naquadah.org


DESCRIPTION:
    Although I consider myself to be a power user, linux_blues is created
    with the average Linux user in mind.  My goal is for both the power user
    and average user to feel right at home.

FEATURES:
    - Clean, minimal interface
    - Dynamic widgets
        - Color feedback to reflect current state
        - Mouse over to reveal more information
    - Support for dynamic control of window transparency
    - I am constantly adding things when I have more ideas and I am very
      open to suggestions!

      called .config/awesome (if .config does not already exist, it will
      have to be created first)
    - to install linux_blues, enter the following commands in a terminal:
         cd /tmp
         git clone git://github.com/slackbyte/linux_blues.git
         cp -r /tmp/linux_blues/* $HOME/.config/awesome
    - if awesome is currently running, it will have to be restarted
      (shortcut: Mod4+Shift+r)
    - celebrate your success in installing linux_blues in whatever way you
      are accustomed


Suggestions are always more than welcome! If you are having issues, as
always google is your friend and mine.  But if that is somehow unsuccessful,
I am willing to attempt to help you in any way I can, though I maintain that
I am not responsible for any problems that result from you choosing to use
this configuration or theme.
